You will find all configurations and settings under the main navigation point `system` with the following sub-navigation:

* System
* Themes
* Plugins
* Account
* Users

All settings are stored in the `\settings` folder of Typemill. It is not recommended to edit the settings manually, because it might crash the system if done wrong.
