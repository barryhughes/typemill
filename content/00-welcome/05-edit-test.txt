["# Write Content","Typemill provides easy and intuitive authoring tools and we work hard to create a good author experience. With the interactive navigation you can create pages and structure your websites. The visual markdown editor will help you to create content in a wysiwyg mode. The publish bar gives you full control over the status of each page. Watch the following video tutorial to learn all the details.","* You can change the default mode in the system settings. \n* You can also switch each format button on and off in the system settings.","The publish bar of Typemill is pretty intuitiv and sticks at the bottom of the screen so that you have always full control of the status of each page. Simply play around with it and you will quickly understand how it works. In short:","* The green button \"online\" indicates, that your page is published and visible for your readers.\n* You can depublish a page by clicking the green \"online\" button. The button will turn gray with the label \"offline\" and the page is not visible for your readers anymore.\n* With the green button \"Publish\" you can either publish a page that is offline or you can publish some unpublished changes on your page.\n* The publish-button is gray and disabled, if the page is online and if there are no unpublished changes.\n* All buttons will change in real time, so you can always exactly see what is going on.\n* To provide an easy status-overview of the whole website, Typemill marks all pages in the navigation on the left side as published (green), changed (orange) and unpublished (red).","## Working with Drafts","Ever tried to revise a published article in WordPress? Yes, it works, but if you click on \"save\", then all your changes are directly live. Typemill is much more flexible here and allows you to keep your original version live while you work on a **drafted version** in the background. This is how Typemill handles it: ","* In **visual mode**: Typemill stores your changes in a new draft automatically as soon as you save any content-block.\n* In **raw mode**: To store changes in a new draft, simply click on the \"save draft\"-button in the publish controller.\n* You can work on a draft as long as you want without changing the live version. Your changes go live if you click the button \"publish\".\n* In visual mode, you can also use the discard-button and go back to the published version."]
