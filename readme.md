## Tech-stack of Typemill 2

Typemill 2 will use the following tech-stack:

* Slim framework version 4
* Vue.js version 3
* Tailwind css

With slim framework 4 Typemill 2 will run on PHP 8.0 or 8.1 and higher.

The code of Typemill 2 will be refactored in most parts.

## New license system

Typemill 2 will stay under the MIT-license. 

I will try to update all current plugins and themes to version 2, so that the community can proceed with the further development.

I will also proceed with the development of old and new plugins, but I will use a new commercial license with two different subscription plans. This will help to refinance the open source license of the core system.
